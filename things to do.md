things to do

- get click in cv2 window: find pixel coordinates of it
    - could use PLT or pygame for it.
- track the floating ball - using LK optical flow, or some form of color-threshold trakcing
    - Gaussian Yardstick Extrapolation but for chem? 
- requires a line of tape on the burette at the 0mL and 50mL line, to calculate the volume

- Stirrer system?
